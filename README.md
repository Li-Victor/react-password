# react-password

A password generator app. Every time the app is loaded or click on the Get More button, 5 new random passwords appear. Inspired by blog post https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-production/, which is a good blog post in using express.js with react.js.

Made with [**react-express**](https://github.com/Li-Victor/react-express).
